# Instructions

Create a Quarto markdown document and answer the questions below using code blocks that generate the correct outputs. We encourage you to include explanatory text in your markdown document, however **each of your solutions should show how to generate the answer using R code**.

Write "robust" solutions wherever possible. A good rule of thumb for judging whether your solution is appropriately "robust" is to ask yourself "If I added additional observations or variables to this data set, or if the order of variables changed, would my code still compute the right solution?"

Make sure your markdown is nicely formatted -- use headers, bullets, numbering, etc so that the structure of the document is clear.

Make sure to "Render" your document before submission to confirm that all code blocks and formatting is as you expect.

When completed, title your markdown file as follows (replace `XX` with the assignemnt number, e.g. `01`, `02`, etc):

-   `netid-assignment_XX-Fall2024.qmd`

Submit both your markdown file (`.qmd`) and the generated HTML document (`.html`) on your Github site.



### Problems

1. Locate a graphic in a publication that you think does *not* represent graphical excellence. Provide the reference and figure number. Download or grab a screenshot of the graphic and insert it into your homework notebook. Explain what is not great about the graphic and what you think could be done better. 


Using the [NC Births dataset](https://github.com/Bio723-class/example-datasets/raw/master/nc-births.txt) (see last week's HW for details), generate the following plots. For each plot use appropriate readable axis labels, colors, etc. 


2. A scatter plot showing the relationship between weeks of gestation and birth weight, with points colored by birth status (premature vs full term).

3. A density plot showing the distribution of baby birth weights for smoking and non-smoking mothers. Use `geom_rug` to depict the marginal distributions.

4. A boxplot comparing birth weight for premature and full term babies, with mother's smoking status indicated by color.

5. Draw a scatter plot showing the relationship between mothers age and fathers age. Use `coord_equal()` to insure that the x- and y-axes have a fixed ratio, and modify the plot limits to include the origin. Color the points by birth status.

6. Use the [patchwork library](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) to combine the previous four plots into a single 2 x 2 grid of plots, with labels A to D.



## Data lunch assignment

Identify something that you learned from the presentation or discussion on Thursday that you found valuable. Provide a brief reflection here (1-5 sentences) and include code or pseudo-code if useful. Hint: if you have specific code examples, consider adding them to your notebook as well.
