# Instructions

Create a Quarto markdown document and answer the questions below using code blocks that generate the correct outputs. We encourage you to include explanatory text in your markdown document, however **each of your solutions should show how to generate the answer using R code**.

Write "robust" solutions wherever possible. A good rule of thumb for judging whether your solution is appropriately "robust" is to ask yourself "If I added additional observations or variables to this data set, or if the order of variables changed, would my code still compute the right solution?"

Make sure your markdown is nicely formatted -- use headers, bullets, numbering, etc so that the structure of the document is clear.

Make sure to "Render" your document before submission to confirm that all code blocks and formatting is as you expect.

When completed, title your markdown file as follows (replace `XX` with the assignemnt number, e.g. `01`, `02`, etc):

-   `netid-assignment_XX-Fall2024.qmd`

Submit both your markdown file (`.qmd`) and the generated HTML document (`.html`) on your Github site.


## Background 

In this problem set you will build on the poem parsing functions we developed in class to carry out additional analyses on a small corpus of poems and song lyrics.

### Poems and song lyrics corpus

We've put a zip file with a small corpus of poems and song lyrics available on the course website at the following link:

* [poem-corpus.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bio724D/Bio724D_2024_2025/refs/heads/main/data/poem-corpus.zip)

Download and unzip this file, putting the directory (`poems_corpus`) in your working directory. Each file is named with the following convention: 

`firstname_lastname_Poem-or-Song-Title.txt`

Note that underscores separate fields and dashes separate words within a single field.

### Problems


1. Write a for-loop to read each of the files in the `poems_corpus` directory, returning a list with four character vectors containing:  (1) the authors first names; (2) authors last names; (3) poem/song title; (4) text of the poem/song.  

   HINT: use the `list.files` function to get a list of all the files in a directory: 
   
   ```
   poem_files <- list.file(path='/path/to/poems_corpus', 
                           pattern="*.txt",
                           full.name = TRUE)
   ```


2. Create an empty data frame with the following column names and types and assign it the variable name `poems_df`:  

  * `first_name` (character)
  * `last_name` (character)
  * `title` (character)
  * `stanza` (integer)
  * `num_lines` (integer)
  * `num_words` (integer)
  * `num_alpha` (integer)
  * `num_punct` (integer)
  
3. Write a for-loop to iterate over the vectors you created in Problem 1 in parallel. Apply the `analyze_poem` function to the text of each poem, and use mutate to add author and title information to the output of `analyze_poem`. Merge each resulting data frame into `poems_df` using the `dplyr::bind_rows`.

4. Using the output of Problem 3, add the following metrics (per stanza) to the data frame:

  * `word_complexity` -- the average number of alphanumeric characters per word
  * `punct_density` -- the average number of punctuation characters per line
  
5. On a per poem basis (hint: `group_by`), generate a derived data frame with the following:

  * `stanza_complexity` -- the average word_complexity for the poem as a whole 
  * `poem_complexity` -- the number of stanzas times the stanza complexity
  * `punct_metric` -- the median punct_density for the poem as a whole
  
6. What are the top three poems in terms of `poem_complexity`? What are the top three poems in terms of `stanza_complexity`?

7. Which author's poems have the smallest `punct_metric`?
