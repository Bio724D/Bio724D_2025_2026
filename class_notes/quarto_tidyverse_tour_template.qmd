# Installing packaages

See in class demo on the Packages install dialog.

-   Install the tidyverse package



# Quarto

Quarto is a tool for scientific documentation and publishing. In this class we'll be using Quarto documents as the primary method for writing, testing, and exploring R code.

## In-class tour of Quarto

-   Create a Quarto document

-   Review Quarto interface in RStudio

-   Visual vs Source editor view

-   Code blocks

-   Interactive notebook model vs document rendering â€“ discuss differences and possible points of confusion about execution models

    -   Take-home: When testing your notebooks (e.g. homeworks!) use the `Session > Restart R and Run All Chunks` menu item to make sure your code runs without error
    
    
# Loading packages

Once a package is installed we can load it the the `library` function:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

    

# Data import using the readr package

The `readr` package is one of the libraries included when we installed the tidyverse. The readr package provide a wide variety of functions for loading common data formats like CSV, TSV, and other delimited data types.



## Load a data file using `readcsv`

If you haven't already, download [`penguins.csv`](), save it to the folder we asked you to create in your home directory (`~/Bio724`) and load it as follows:

```{r}
penguins <- read_csv("~/Bio724/penguins.csv")
```


## Penguins!

# Simple data frame manipulations

When the penguins data set is loaded it is treated as a "data frame", which is an R data structure that represents tabular data. The data frame is the data structure we'll be using most often in this class.

Basic functions for getting a handle on what's in a data frame

-   `View`
-   `dim`
-   `head` and `tail`
-   `str`

# Basic plots

## Raw data plot and jittering


## Histograms


## Density plots


## Violin plots


## Boxplots


## Representing a categorical variable


# Faceting



# Some basic data analysis



## ANOVA to test difference in group means


# Bivariate scatter plots




# Basic filtering with dplyr



# Faceting on multiple variables


## 2D density plot


# Grouping on multiple variables to produce summaries of interest
