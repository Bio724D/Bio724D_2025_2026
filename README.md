Course website for Biology 724D: Foundations of Data Science for Biologists (2025-2026 AY)


### Course Description

This course is a two-semester sequence that provides an overview of computing and data analysis concepts and tools that are frequently used throughout the biological sciences. Topics covered include: data filtering and restructuring; data visualization and effective communication; data science best practices for reproducability, reusability, and discovery; and working effectively with big data. Students will learn how to leverage key tools from the Unix, R, and Python computing ecosystems.

### Course Goals and Objectives

The primary goal is to provide a foundation of practical computing concepts and skills for beginning graduate students in the Department of Biology that will aid them in their graduate resaerch and profession life well beyond. Important secondary goals are (1) inculcating best practices in data management, analysis, and dissemination, and (2) introducing each new cohort of students to more senior trainees in the department and the breadth of research they are conducting.
